title: Pancake Cut-Flip
difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Given an array of integers, apply the pancake cut-flip algorithm.
longdesc:
	The "pancake cut-flip" algorithm is a very simple array-reversal splitting algorith. Given an array
	of integers [0, 1, 2, ... n-1] and a "cut index", you are to split the array into two ararys at this
	index: the first array is to be left alone while the second is to be revered. This algorithm is called
	the pancake flip because the entire algorithm is essecially just a stack-poping exercise. Print boht
	arrays at the end of your function.
	
input:
	list - The given array of integers
	i - The index the cut should apply to; this cut is inclusive and should left this target element with the original list
output:
	Print both arrays once the cut and flip is applied

[code]
starter:
	|def pancake_cut(list, i):
	|	# Apply algorithm and print both list components
	|	print []
	|	print []

[sample]
code:
	pancake_cut([0, 1, 2, 3], 1)
	pancake_cut([53, 64, 86, 12, 98, 23, 76], 3)

input:
output:
	[0, 1]
	[3, 2]
	[53, 64, 86, 12]
	[76, 23, 98]

[test]
code:
	print student_list([["Bob", 66], ["Alice", 68], ["Rose", 58], ["Stella", 60]])
	print student_list([["Jeremy", 64], ["John", 64], ["Juliette", 64], ["Ivan", 57], ["Ivo", 58], ["Zach", 64]])

input:
output:
	["Rose", "Stella", "Bob", "Alice"]
	["Ivan", "Ivo", "Jeremy", "John", "Juliette", "Zach"]
