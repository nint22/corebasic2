difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Compare two names and see if they are too similar.
longdesc:
	You are to write a function that returns True of two given baby names are overly similar. We define
	"similar" as two strings having the same length and only differ in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel"
	vowels</a>. In this challenge, we will only use the vowels of the English language: "A", "E", "I",
	"O", "U". Your function should ignore case, since case sensitivy isn't associated with pronounciation.
	
	As an example, the names "polo" and "pola" are too similar because the last letters are both vowels
	and are both different. The names "polo" and "polk" are also too similar, even though the "K" in the
	second name is not a vowel, since it conflicts with the "O" vowel in the last name. The names "pele"
	and "bele" are different enough since none of their vowels are different.
	
input:
	name1 - The first baby name to compare with; at least of length 1
	name2 - The second baby name to compare with; at least of length 1
output:
	Print True if the names are too different, False otherwise

[code]
starter:
	|def too_similar(name1, name2):
	|	return False

[sample]
code:
	print too_similar("polo", "pola")
	print too_similar("pele", "bele")

input:
output:
	True
	False

[test]
code:
	print too_similar("polo", "pola")
	print too_similar("pele", "bele")
	print too_similar("ivo", "ibo")
	print too_similar("evo", "ivo")

input:
output:
	True
	False
	False
	True
