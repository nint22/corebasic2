title: Downsizing
difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Choose which employees to fire or hire.
longdesc:
	Your business is having some financial difficulty. You must write a program to choose one of three
	given employees to fire as well as whether or not you should hire someone new.
	
	Given three employee's salaries a, b, and c, you must fire both the lowest and highest salary. Simply
	print the letter of the employee (a, b, or c) that is not to be fired. Since this once three-person
	team is now down to one, you must also decide if he or she needs an assistent based on that assistants
	starting salary. If the given assistant's salary d is lower than the employee not to be fired, print
	the string ", hire assistant" on the same line as the saved employee. Otherwise, print ", no assistant". If there are matching saleries,
	(i.e. a has the same salary as b or c) then keep the first employee (a has priority over b whome has
	priority over c).
	
input:
	a, b, c - Three employee's salaries as integers
	d - The assistant's starting salary
output:
	Print the letter (a, b, or c) of the employee not to be fired and the string " and hire assistant"
	if that saved employees salary is higher than the assistant's.
