title: Power Plant Simulation
difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Simulate a powerplant's activities over several weeks.
longdesc:
	A powerplant for the small city of Bluemond, Washington needs you to write a function that
	simulates the total number of down-times during a given time period of days represented
	as an integer n. Assume when simulating the first day is a Monday and that a week is a standard 7-day
	week.
	
	The powerplant knows that on average, it goes offline twice in a week for maintence: Monday and
	Thursday. Also, every 14 days (end of every two weeks) the plant goes offline because mandatory emergency testing. Finally,
	every 30 days (at the end of the month) the plant goes offline because of software upgrades.
	
	Write a function that returns the total number of times the powerplant goes offline during the
	given number of days.
	
input:
	n - Number of days to simulate; will always be positive but may be zero
output:
	Return the number of times the powerplant goes offline

[sample]
code:
	print simulate_powerplant(7)
	print simulate_powerplant(30)

	9

[test]
code:
	print simulate_powerplant(7)
	print simulate_powerplant(30)
	print simulate_powerplant(700)
	print simulate_powerplant(0)
